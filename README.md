# Gamefication
##Project description. 
Even in despite of the growth of digitalization in the modern society in all of its spheres, e.g. social games and timespending with friends there are still some activities, which are not fully available in the world of computer and mobile games. Very few children, young people and even less of elder ones would rather choose to play desktop and card games in digital world, than the real one. Ok, the appearence and popularity of online card games, such as Hearthstone is incredible, but many aspects its' popularity are easily explained by the existence of the "free" niche. The innovative approach to such games and the quality requirements on the one hand, lead Blizzard to less often relases of patches on the one hand and on the other one, slow content appearence. And these aspects mostly "make" such type of games in reality. 


Nowadays, some table games are presented in the mobile markets, but their diversity is often depressing.The main idea of our project is to create a universal platform and to bring table and card games to the digital world without any loss of sincere feelings, obtained while playing with your friends in real life. 


For players this means the ability to play in any of available games, using any of your devices (mobile or desktop ones) as the "deck" (some kind of a remote) and another one (desktop monitor, TV display, tablet, or another phone) as a playing field. This oppotunity will help friends, playing together in real life to interact each other, without always staring in their phones and bringing the common field to interact with and discuss. For the games like Activity, Uno, Monopoly e.t.c. the possibility of playing online is vital.


The functional of "playing board" is usefull when you want to play from home with other people from all over the world and watch at the "picture of a battle" on the big screen of your TV by streaming the image through the Chromecast e.g., or just watching at tournaments or other matches. 


Also if you don't have enougth players in your team, you can find the missing ones in our ladder, or being a solo player, you can easily find a team to play your favoirite game. 


The addition of card games can attract large fan society of them by bringing an ability to bring your own content in them by suggesting the idea on forums or vouting for them. Some games can easily be combined with some kind of unified communication, e.g. Skype or Lync to interact with your friends. 


The fairness of every game is guaranteed by the artifician intelligence and the proceccing of all data on the server side of our platform. 


For developers our sollution brings the ability to deploy their games on our cloud platform and to get a large ammount of players, flexible API for ratings and voting. 


On the moment of its release, our platform will support our developed games, such as Activity, SeaBattles and Card Game. 

The cloud server side of the platform helps it to be flexible, always available and close to the customer with the help of CDNs
